# samples

These four samples represent the great range of work that I've done as an engineer and student. They vary in terms of intended audience, complexity, language, and utility. 

### Sample 1: CS_131_HW_2: "Naive parsing of context free grammars"
I completed this homework assignmnet for Paul Eggert's programming class at UCLA in the fall of 2016. It's written in OCaml, a language I was unfamiliar with before his class. This simple program for me represented the difference between academic software and the kind I had been writing for the last three years as a software developer. It was a deceptively challenging assignment. The program was simple-- create a program that parsed text based on certain grammar rules-- but the highly recursive strategy necessary to complete this task was not. More on this assignment here: 

### Sample 2: Classifier_Prototype: A quick-and-dirty image classification model
